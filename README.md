# Explain-ML

Explain-ML is a web based  application, developed using the  Python Web framework Django \footnote{\url{https://www.djangoproject.com/}}, using Sqlite\footnote{\url{https://www.sqlite.org/index.html}}. The screenshots and visualizations presented in this section are related to a version of \textit{Explain-ML}, instantiated with Random Forests (as ML model) applied to automatic text classification (ATC) (as ML task). The instantiated version employs the Scikit-Learn \footnote{\url{https://scikit-learn.org/stable/}} implementation of the  Random Forests Model. The initial design of ExplainML focused on demonstrating our hypotheses that a multi-view and multi-perspective visualization  approach for interpreting results could aid users to better interpret the results of a ML model.
Explain-ML is based on the work presented in [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.04938) ([bibtex here for citation](citation.bib))
